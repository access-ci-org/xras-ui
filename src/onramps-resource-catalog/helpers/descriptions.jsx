  "CPU": (<p><strong>CPU Compute</strong> resources deflector power at maximum. Energy discharge in six seconds. Warp reactor core primary coolant failure. Fluctuate phaser resonance frequencies. A a remarkable piece of bio-electronic engineering by which I see much of the EM spectrum ranging from heat and infrared through radio waves. Resistance is futile.</p>),
  "GPU": (<p><strong>GPU Compute</strong> resources ricotta lasagna banana peppers white garlic buffalo sauce red onions sauteed onions green bell peppers chicken wing. Hawaiian melted cheese deep crust pesto parmesan chicken and bacon bacon & tomato pepperoni personal garlic sauce pork spinach steak.</p>),
  "Innovative": (<p><strong>Innovative / Novel Compute</strong> resources throd n'ghft Nyarlathotep hupadgh ya ftaghu y-hai gotha vulgtm Tsathoggua hupadgh vulgtlaglnor mg fhtagn</p>),
  "Cloud": (<p><strong>Cloud</strong> resources a strange set-up, but I'd say the graviton generator is depolarized. The dark colourings of the scrapes are the leavings of natural rubber, a type of non-conductive sole used by researchers experimenting with electricity. The molecules must have been partly de-phased by the anyon beam.</p>),
  "Storage": (<p><strong>Storage</strong> resources shut them all down! Hurry! Listen to them! They're dying, Artoo! Curse my metal body! I wasn't fast enough. It's all my fault! My poor master!</p>),
